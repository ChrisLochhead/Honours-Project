## Honours Project

Game is currently in its infancy, being developed in Unity using C#. 

The game will be outfitted with functionality to build customisable maps, train and play against AI. The gameplay elements, when implemented, will be such that a bad AI (or non-life-like) will be immidiately noticeable to the average player. 

The end goal for this game is not only to test my own hypothesise on what machine learning methods are best for developing convincing game AI; but also for people in future who stumble upon this repo to conduct there own testing. For this to be possible the game must be extremely robust.

The game is currently a menu system and map loader, with limited functionality in each. Near future improvements are the adding of basic gameplay (with players) and a remedial build system for generating custom maps: possibly with future scope for randomisable maps to save time.
